# About the project

This is a simple terminal text editor made in C, made to excercise with C code and terminal applications;

Obviously this is a project not suited for any kind of use, but only as a learning exprerience;

Some of this code took inspiration (aka copied) from [Kilo](https://github.com/antirez/kilo/tree/master);

## Build

The project uses `make` to create build binaries, the project should work in all UNIX systems;

```bash
make
```

You should see a file inside `./bin` directory called `main`
to run the program simply do

```bash
./main
```

### NOTE

I'm not an expert C programmer, this codebase may or may not be a good example of C code.
This is one of my first project using this language, so it may contain bugs and bad practices
