# About the project

This is a simple terminal text editor made in C, made to excercise with C code and terminal applications;

Obviously this is a project not suited for any kind of use, but only as a learning exprerience;

Some of this code took inspiration (aka copied) from [Kilo](https://github.com/antirez/kilo/tree/master);
